"""Data loading utilities.

This module now performs *only* file existence checks and JSON parsing.
All structural / semantic validation of plants, orders, and settings has
been moved to the dedicated validation functions in ``input_Validations``.

Design choice
-------------
Separating parsing from validation keeps I/O concerns (file reading &
deserialization) decoupled from business rules. Tests that assert error
conditions for malformed content must now explicitly call the validation
functions (``validate_plants`` / ``validate_orders``) after loading.
